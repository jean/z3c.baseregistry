1.0.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Ensure that original registry restoring action is
  performed last, by specifying sys.maxint order for it.
  This is a workaround for bug that appears when there's
  actions with specified (large) order, so original registry
  is restored _before_ that action is executed. One of
  examples is _checkViewFor action in zope.app.publisher's
  addMenuItem directive.

1.0.0 (2008-01-24)
